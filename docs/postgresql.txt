As Rhombus uses SQLAlchemy as its database library system, all information
pertaining the use of PostgreSQL in SQLAlchemy applies.

To set up PostgreSQL database for Rhombus use, follow the below instructions:

- Set up PostgreSQL according to your Linux distribution
- Create the database as PostgreSQL admin user


POSTGRESQL SETUP


DATABASE CREATION AND DELETION

To create a new database, run the following command as PostgreSQL admin user:

$ createdb -O OWNERNAME DBNAME
$ psql DBNAME -c "DROP EXTENSION plpgsql"

Note: plpgsql extension is not used anyway, and dropping this extension will make
it easier for backing-up and restoring the database.

To delete (or drop) database, run the following instead:

$ dropdb DBNAME


DATABASE BACKUP AND RESTORE

To dump a database, use the following command:

$ pg_dump -U USERNAME -h HOST -f OUTFILE DBNAME

To restore from sql dump scripts, use the folowwing command:

$ psql -U USERNAME -h HOST -f INFILE DBNAME


SCHEMA MIGRATION

Sometimes, during development, we need to modify the SQL schema. Use alembic
to manage the schema.
